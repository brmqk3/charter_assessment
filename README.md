1. Must run with Python 2.x, Python 3.x will result in compile failures, at least due to print statements.
   Let me know if I need to convert to Python 3, and I can push up a change.
2. Both applications have some test code down below that can be uncommented, modified, and used.
3. For create_hash_table.py:
    a. Option 1:
        i. uncomment the test code
        ii. modify the contents of input.txt
        iii. run "create_hash_table.py --input_file=input.txt"
    b. Option 2:
        i. import the class from the file
        ii. create new instance of the class
        iii. call explodereport() directly, providing input in the form of a tuple or array of strings
4. change_delta_object.py should run as is. Just import the class and use the associated functions
